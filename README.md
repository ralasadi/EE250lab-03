## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1:
RESTFUL APIs are scalable because they are able to seperate the client and the server, allowing them to develop each of them independetly. Additionally, RESTFUL APIs are stateless, which reduces server load since it does not need to store any client state. Another reason is because they use standard protocols such as HTTP, allowing them to be implemented universally.

Answer for Question 2:
According to the AWS article, resources are the information that the applications provide to the clients. The mail server is providing the client with the inbox, mail from sender, etc.

Answer for Question 3:
One common REST method not used in our mail server is cacheability which is the process of storing some responses on the client or an intermeidsary to improve server response time. We could extend our mail server to use this method by having the client cache a resource.

Answer for Question 4:
API keys are used for many RESTful APIs because many of these APIs are subscription based and so the API keys provide access and authorization for the user requesting the service. For example, if I purchased a subscription to an API service, then I would be provided with an API key for access. This would prevent a user that is a non subscriber from using this REST API.
